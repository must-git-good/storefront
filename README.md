# storefront
An example of using node to query and manipulate a database in a 'real world' setting.


## Take a Look: 

This project is currently complete, but isn't web-deployable (it exists on and references local databases, currently)
* Take a look at how the program would flow if you were running it yourself:

### Purpose

As a node application created during my time at UT Austin's Coding Bootcamp, this project displays my ability to use MySQL databases through a node interface in a 'real' use-case situation.

```
* Complex node implementation including multiple npms.
* MySQL database creation and dynamic interaction.
* A thoughtful approach to user interaction.

```
