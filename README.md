### Purpose

As a node application created during my time at UT Austin's Coding Bootcamp, this project displays my ability to use MySQL databases through a node interface in a 'real' use-case situation.

```
* Complex node implementation including multiple npms.
* MySQL database creation and dynamic interaction.
* A thoughtful approach to user interaction.

```
